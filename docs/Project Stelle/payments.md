# Payment Information
*This is all information pertaining to Project Stelle's payment system!*

Project Stelle uses a trusted third-party service, [Stripe](https://stripe.com), to securely process all transactions. At no point does Project Furina Staff have access to your full payment credentials (e.g., card numbers, CVV, bank login).

## Platform Fees

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com) charges a variable processing fee, typically between **2.9% and 5%**, depending on the payment method and location.
  - This can vary due to fees in different countries, payment methods, etc, and this is merely an inclusive estimate.
- [Project Stelle](https://stelle.project-furina.xyz) takes a fixed **3% service fee**.
  - Please note, this might be changed in the future to be **2% or 1%** later down the road.

You typically receive around **90-95%** of the total payment after fees.
